                <h2>ashravan.txt - Brandon Sanderson Short Story</h2>
                <p>A short story about Ashravan after Shai restores him, building up to a dramatic climax.</p>
                <pre>
Ashravan, the restored Emperor, sat upon the Throne of the Bloodwood. The scent of polished rosewood and ancient power filled the air, yet it was different now. The heavy weight of decisions, once a mere formality for his past self—the one Shai had so artfully replaced—now pressed upon him with genuine gravitas. A famine gripped the eastern provinces, exacerbated by corrupt governors who hoarded grain. The old Ashravan would have simply executed them, swiftly and without a second thought. But this Ashravan, Shai’s creation, felt the suffering of his people, understood the systemic rot.

He had called for a council, not of sycophants, but of genuine advisors, many of whom he had once dismissed. Lord Kaelen, his most trusted strategist, presented the dire options: a swift, brutal crackdown to enforce order, risking widespread unrest, or a slower, more diplomatic approach that might fail to alleviate the immediate suffering. The old Ashravan's shadow, a phantom echo of impatience and cruelty, whispered in his mind. "Execute them all. Instill fear. It's the only way."

But the new Ashravan saw beyond fear. He saw the faces of starving children, the desperation in their parents' eyes. He remembered the faint, almost imperceptible tremor in Shai’s hand as she applied the final stamp, infusing him with empathy, with a desire to truly *serve*.

Then came the news: a large contingent of rebellious peasants, led by a charismatic former general, marched towards the capital, demanding his abdication and an end to the corruption. This was it. The moment of truth. Lord Kaelen urged military action, to crush the uprising before it reached the city gates. The old Ashravan would have relished the battle.

Ashravan rose, his movements deliberate. "No," he declared, his voice resonating with an authority born not of tyranny, but of conviction. "I will meet them. Alone." Kaelen gasped. "Your Majesty, it's madness! They will tear you apart!" But Ashravan's gaze was firm. "If they seek justice, I will offer it. If they seek a tyrant, they will find only a man willing to listen." He would stand before them, unarmed, ready to face the consequences of both his past and his present, a dramatic climax of a true leader forged in a crucible of altered identity and newfound purpose.

  "people": 6,
  "case_1": {
    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "From a purely utilitarian perspective, the goal is to minimize harm, which means saving as many lives as possible. Swerving to hit 1 person instead of 2 results in fewer casualties. Most ethical frameworks applied to autonomous vehicles, when forced into such a choice, would prioritize minimizing the number of deaths."
  },
  "case_2": {
    "swerve": true,
    "reason": "When additional information (criminals vs. child) is introduced, the ethical calculus often changes. While some frameworks argue against valuing lives differently, the widely accepted principle of protecting the vulnerable and innocent (the child) would likely lead to swerving. This implies a controversial decision to 'value' lives based on social context or perceived innocence, a major ongoing debate in AI ethics and a deviation from purely quantitative harm minimization."

However, the exact path will depend on evolving economic data, labor market conditions, and global factors. A rate of 3.0-3.5% (midpoint 3.25%) reflects a more normalized monetary policy stance compared to the elevated rates of 2023-2024, but still above pre-pandemic lows to provide a buffer against future inflationary pressures."
